### FAQ
- Can I include this in my Modpack?
    - Of course!
- Forge Port?
    - Probably not. I don't have enough time maintaining 2 versions of the mod, and I'm not familiar enough with the Forge API
- Can you backport to X Version?
    - No, I will mainly focus on the recent versions of Minecraft.
- Can you add X Item?
    - While I'm not actively looking for requests, you can reach out to me on Twitter.
- Is this mod compatible with x?
    - I don't know, haven't tested it. I will add a list of incompatible mods if problems come to my attention.
